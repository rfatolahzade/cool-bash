# Log-Scout üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Professional Log Analyzer for Security Monitoring and IP Analysis**

Log-Scout is a powerful bash script designed to analyze various types of server logs and provide detailed insights into client behavior, helping system administrators and security professionals identify potential threats and monitor server performance.

> **üéØ Note**: While Log-Scout can be adapted for different log formats (Apache, HAProxy, etc.), the current version is specifically optimized for **Nginx logs** with the standard combined log format. For other log types, minor script modifications may be required to correctly identify IP addresses, response codes, and other fields.

> **üí° CDN Tip**: If your CDN (Cloudflare, CloudFront, etc.) provides analytics with real client IPs and request counts, consider using that data first for better accuracy. CDN logs often show the actual client IPs rather than the CDN's IP addresses.

## üöÄ Features

- **IP Request Analysis**: Identify which IPs are making the most requests
- **Detailed URL Breakdown**: See exactly which endpoints each IP is accessing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and status codes per URL
- **Top N Filtering**: Focus on the most active IPs with configurable limits
- **Pattern Filtering**: Filter logs by specific URL patterns (e.g., `/api/`)
- **Color-Coded Output**: Easy-to-read results with status code coloring
- **CIS Compliant**: Built with security best practices in mind

## üìã Sample Usage

```bash
root@Mad:~/cool-bash/log-scout# ./scout-log.sh
=== Nginx Log Professional IP Analyzer ===

Enter log file path: /root/cool-bash/log-scout/access.log
Enter URL pattern to filter (leave empty for all): 
Show top N IPs? Enter number (default 10, 0 for all): 3

Analyzing logs from: /root/cool-bash/log-scout/access.log
Showing top 3 IPs by request count

## üìù Log Format Compatibility

**Default Supported Format (Nginx Combined):**
```bash
log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                '"$http_user_agent" $request_time';
```
And as You could see:
```bash

**Field Mapping:**
- IP Address: `$1` (first field)    -$remote_addr
- Request: `$7` (seventh field)     -$request
- Status Code: `$9` (ninth field)   -$status
- Response Time: `$NF` (last field) -request_time

**For Other Log Formats:**
- **Apache**: Usually compatible with minimal changes
- **HAProxy**: May require field position adjustments
- **Custom Formats**: Modify AWK field references in the script

To adapt for different log formats, identify the correct field positions for:
1. Client IP address
2. Requested URL/endpoint
3. HTTP status code
4. Response time (if available)
