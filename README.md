📝 Note

This repository is a collection of scripts I create while practicing bash scripting. The focus is on practical, real-world utilities that make daily computing tasks easier and more efficient.

**Development Approach**: These scripts are developed through a combination of:
- **Personal requirements** - Based on real needs from my DevOps and security work
- **AI-assisted development** - Using AI tools as a coding assistant for implementation guidance and best practices
- **Hands-on learning** - Each script represents a practical problem I've encountered and solved

The scripts are tested in real environments and refined based on actual usage feedback.

Good luck!🍀
